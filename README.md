# proof-of-context

> *PAL\*M attests that a computation happened correctly; Proof-of-Context makes those attestations economically perishable — binding freshness to settlement so stale inferences cannot clear payment.*

Reference implementation of the **proof-of-context** primitive: an *attestation-as-settlement* layer for decentralized machine learning.

**Position paper:** [github.com/asastuai/proof-of-context](https://github.com/asastuai/proof-of-context) — v0.6 (22 April 2026). Read the paper first; this crate encodes the architecture it names.

**Status:** `v0.2.0`. Phase 2 shipped — SHA-256 Merkle commitments over the execution-context root, Ed25519 signing / verification, `MockCommitter`, `MockVerifier`, `MockSettlementGate` with pluggable verifier generic. End-to-end integration tests pass. Phase 3 (TDX + H100 attestation chain, Drand client, block-RPC client) is the next milestone.

## What this crate is for

Existing verification primitives in decentralized ML (proof-of-learning, zkML, TEE attestations, refereed delegation, inference-activation LSH) answer the question *"was the computation correct?"* They do not answer *"is it still worth settling on?"*

Proof-of-context sits on top of those primitives and gates payment against a *freshness commitment*: a signed bundle of `(execution_context_root, triple_anchor, output_hash)` that expires. If a worker's commitment has aged beyond the protocol-defined horizon when settlement is attempted, payment does not clear — regardless of whether the underlying math was correct.

This crate provides the Rust types and traits for building such a protocol layer.

## Architecture at a glance

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full mapping from paper sections to crate modules.

| Paper section | Module | Core type / trait |
|---|---|---|
| §6 — Four Freshness Types | `freshness` | `FreshnessType`, `FreshnessThresholds` |
| §7 constraint 6 — Triple Anchor | `anchor` | `TripleAnchor` |
| §8 — Execution-Context Root | `context` | `ExecutionContextRoot`, `merkle_root()` |
| §7 constraint 5 + §8 | `commitment` | `FreshnessCommitment`, `ContextCommitter` |
| §3.6 + §6 — Settlement gating | `settle` | `SettlementGate`, `SettlementResult` |
| §7 constraint 5 — Prospective-only bumps | `renewal` | `Renewal`, `RenewalOutcome` |
| §7 constraint 6 + §9 | `attestation` | `AttestationChain`, `AttestationVerifier` |

## Build and test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

Both should succeed on a stock Rust toolchain (2021 edition). The mock backend has no dependencies beyond `sha2`, `ed25519-dalek`, `serde`, and `thiserror`.

## EigenCloud case study

End-to-end demo positioning proof-of-context as the freshness layer above an `EigenCompute` / `EigenAI`-style verifiable-execution primitive:

```bash
cargo run --example eigencompute_freshness_receipt
```

The example walks the honest path, the stale path (where re-execution still agrees but the receipt has aged past its window), and the four cheating modalities from `Proof of Context applied to Verifiable Inference (v0.1)`:

- **M1** model substitution — caught by output-hash mismatch on canonical re-execution
- **M2** request mutation — caught by `ExecutionContextRoot` Merkle disagreement
- **M3** billing inflation — caught by output-hash binding to actual delivered bytes
- **M4** capacity falsification — caught by attestation-chain vendor / payload mismatch

Programmatic equivalents live in `tests/eigencompute_flow.rs`. The motivation: `EigenVerify-Objective` answers *"was the computation deterministic?"* — proof-of-context answers the orthogonal economic question *"is the result still valid to settle on?"*.

## Multi-agent orchestration

Standalone runnable demo of a 3-agent orchestration pipeline that wires the proof-of-context primitives into an agent runtime:

```bash
cargo run --example multi_agent_orchestrator
```

The example covers:

- **Agent runtime** — a uniform `Agent` trait implemented by three concrete agents covering distinct patterns: I/O (`OraclePriceAgent`), pure compute (`DecisionAgent`), state mutation (`SettlementAgent`).
- **Orchestration** — a sequential `Orchestrator` that routes tasks between agents and threads a shared `MemoryStore` through them.
- **Reliability** — typed `AgentError::{Transient, Permanent}` driving retry with exponential backoff or short-circuit on permanent failure.
- **Observability** — pluggable `Observer` trait with default `ConsoleObserver` emitting structured events at every agent boundary.
- **Verifiability** — each successful agent step produces a `FreshnessCommitment`; the orchestrator chains the per-step commitments and seals the chain with a SHA-256 over the ordered signing digests.

Four scenarios run in sequence: honest path, retry-then-success (oracle fails twice then succeeds), permanent failure (oracle endpoint unreachable, pipeline short-circuits), and a chain-hash integrity check. Programmatic equivalents in `tests/multi_agent_orchestrator_flow.rs` (6 tests).

## Roadmap

See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for phased plans. Rough order:

1. **Scaffold (this release).** Traits, types, architectural bones.
2. **Primitives.** SHA-256 Merkle root for execution context; Ed25519 signing; in-process triple-anchor check.
3. **Mock backend.** Software-only committer + settlement gate that exercises the full flow end-to-end in tests.
4. **TEE backend.** TDX + H100 attestation chain verification hooked into the committer.
5. **Drand client.** Real fetch of Drand mainnet rounds; block-RPC client for anchor construction.
6. **SUR Protocol integration.** First deployment — wire proof-of-context into the SUR settlement rail (see [github.com/asastuai/sur-protocol](https://github.com/asastuai/sur-protocol)).
